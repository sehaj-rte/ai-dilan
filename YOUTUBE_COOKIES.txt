YouTube Cookies Setup (Required for Video Transcription)
========================================================

YouTube now requires authentication. To fix this:

1. Install browser extension "Get cookies.txt LOCALLY"
   Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc

2. Go to youtube.com and make sure you're logged in

3. Click the extension icon and export cookies.txt

4. Upload the cookies.txt file to your server

5. Add to .env file:
   YOUTUBE_COOKIES_FILE=/path/to/youtube_cookies.txt

6. Restart the backend server

Note: Cookies expire after 6-12 months. Re-export if transcription stops working.
